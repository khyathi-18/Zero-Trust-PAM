# zero-trust-pam-hybrid-cloud
This project implements a Zero Trust Privileged Access Management (ZT-PAM) framework for hybrid cloud environments, focusing on practical deployment, automated enforcement, and continuous governance. The research operationalizes secure privileged access, enforces least privilege, and demonstrates dynamic, identity-centric control over critical infrastructure across on-premises and cloud resources.

Leveraging NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture) and NIST SP 800-63B (digital identity), the framework replaces persistent administrator access with Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP), protecting high-value accounts and sensitive resources. Open-source tools like Keycloak, HashiCorp Vault, and Wazuh/ELK Stack are integrated to build a fully operational ZT-PAM environment.
