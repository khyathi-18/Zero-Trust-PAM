# Zero-Trust-Privileged-Access-Management-(PAM)-for-Cybersecurity-Governance-in-Hybrid-Clouds
This project implements a Zero Trust Privileged Access Management (ZT-PAM) framework for hybrid cloud environments, focusing on practical deployment, automated enforcement, and continuous governance. The research operationalizes secure privileged access, enforces least privilege, and demonstrates dynamic, identity-centric control over critical infrastructure across on-premises and cloud resources.

Leveraging NIST SP 800-207 (Zero Trust Architecture) and NIST SP 800-63B (digital identity), the framework replaces persistent administrator access with Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP), protecting high-value accounts and sensitive resources. Open-source tools like Keycloak, HashiCorp Vault, and Wazuh/ELK Stack are integrated to build a fully operational ZT-PAM environment.
# Research Objectives
RQ1 (Feasibility of ZSP): Can Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) be consistently enforced across on-premise and cloud resources using a unified policy engine?
RQ2 (Adaptive Access): How well can a Zero Trust system use information about who the user is, how secure their device is, and whether they’re making a temporary access request, to make sure privileged users only get the minimum access they need, only when it’s safe?
RQ3 (Governance & Auditability): Can centralized session monitoring and tamper-proof logs support regulatory compliance and cybersecurity governance in hybrid clouds?
# Methodology
**Step 1 – Environment Setup & Inventory**  
Deploy a simulated hybrid environment using Docker containers for on-premises databases and cloud resource simulation.  
Inventory all privileged accounts and define the protected surface.  
Tools: Docker, AWS CLI, Azure CLI  
Goal: Establish a controlled hybrid cloud environment for testing ZT-PAM policies.  

**Step 2 – Identity Centralization**  
Implement a central Identity Provider (IdP) with mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all privileged roles.  
Set up credential vaulting for privileged accounts.  
Tools: Keycloak, HashiCorp Vault  
Goal: Enforce explicit verification and secure identity management (AAL3 compliance).  

**Step 3 – Policy Engine (PE) Development**  
Develop Policy-as-Code (PAC) rules that enforce Just-in-Time (JIT) access and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP).  
Define dynamic, context-aware policies based on identity, device posture, and session attributes.  
Tools: Open Policy Agent (OPA), Rego  
Goal: Implement least privilege and dynamic access enforcement.  

**Step 4 – Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) Configuration**   
Deploy a secure proxy or broker to authenticate users through the IdP, request access decisions from the Policy Engine, and provide short-lived credentials.  
Tools: Teleport or Boundary (Community Edition)  
Goal: Enforce Zero Trust access control in real-time across hybrid environments.  

**Step 5 – Monitoring & Audit**  
Enable session recording for all privileged sessions.  
Aggregate login, access, and command logs into a unified SIEM/logging system.  
Configure alerts for anomalous activities.  
Tools: ELK Stack, Wazuh, PEP session logs  
Goal: Provide centralized auditing, continuous diagnostics, and regulatory compliance.  

**Step 6 – Governance Mapping & Compliance Validation**  
Map technical controls to NIST SP 800-207, SP 800-53, CSA CCM, and ISO 27001 standards.  
Document evidence of policy enforcement, session logging, and anomaly detection.  
Goal: Validate the effectiveness of ZT-PAM for cybersecurity governance in hybrid clouds.  

**Step 7 – Workflow Simulation & Testing**  
Simulate privileged access workflows across on-premises and cloud resources.  
Test the enforcement of JIT, ZSP, and dynamic policies.  
Analyze session logs and alerts to measure compliance and security improvements.
